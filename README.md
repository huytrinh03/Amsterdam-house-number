# Amsterdam-house-number
 Visualizing Amsterdam's house numbers using Python

 This project is inspired by Nicolas Kruchten's article on Montreal house numbers: https://nicolas.kruchten.com/content/2015/04/mtl_housenumbers/

 In this project, I queried data from the OpenStreetMap project with the help from its Overpass turbo Query Wizard. After obtaining the data, I clean them with pandas and plotted them using plotly. The resulting plot presents the Dutch capital's house numbers from 1 to 6000 with rainbow colors.
